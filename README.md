## Description
This homework project was all about using Javascript to create a functional quiz with different questions, a timer countdown that detracts time for wrong questions, a high scores page that can be saved with initials. This project involved creating an HTML and CSS sheet form scratch and then manipulating the elements from within a Javascript file. 

## Installation 
This site is deployed through gitHub https://mj470.github.io/Coding-Quiz-Challange-JavaScript/

## Usage
The functional quiz will welcome the user to a the quiz and explain the perameters of the quiz. The timer will begin on the start button. The questions will pop up with four answers. For every wrong answer time is detracted. The results page will then show when the quiz is finished. The user will have the option to view high scores and submit their results tied to their initials.
